Android-App
===========

TODO List:

1.  Write a proper readme
2.  Comment the code
3.  Open source license of some sort
4.  Tidy up the settings page
5.  Provide links to a directions provider or generate them inline? http://developer.mapquest.com/
6.  Meeting formats
7.  Tidy up the List page
8.  The tab buttons on the bottom are acting funny. Sometimes you need click twice on them so that they
    have correct focus appearance.
9.  Remove console.log statements from js
10.	Have a search from this address option
11. Reset search days when choosing search for meetings from the home page after previously choosing 
    search for meetings today/tomorrow
12. Investigate what to do if the app is minimised during a slow xhr/geolocation request. Things seem 
    to get messed up on restore i.e. search results doubled, session management/caching
13. Figure out a better way to calculate the height of the map
14. Map resize on change from horizontal to vertical and vice-versa
15.
